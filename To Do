BUSINESS / MARKETING TO-DO'S

Look at Allen Maxwell's Snowbird app to see if I can help him to improve his code
    See if pagination loads all rows before index view, or if it only loads one page.
    If so, his app can be made far smoother with queries.

Find other collaborators
    It seems I've reached a point where it's foolish to continue all this work that I'm doing on my own. Is it time to seek other teachers to help develop study guides and lesson plans?
    Is it more important to seek additional software devs to get the site up to speed?
    Is it more important to seek investors so that I can pay salaries to the other people who are helping?
    Lately, I'm feeling more like the GoalTracker feature might be more useful to a wider variety of teachers. (At least, it might be more useful sooner).  Spreading that feature is 
        a more attainable goal than spreading the DeskConsultants feature. Is it foolish to change the main business plan at this point? If I do change the plan, how does that affect 
        my decision for proceeding with content writers, coders, or investors?
    How about this plan:
        Continue developing GoalTracker myself until next spring.
        In Spring, pursue opportunities to spread the work to other teachers. Get a few more teachers using the app and giving feedback.
        Then I'll have something to pitch to companies/investors
        Content takes a backseat, because it isn't very useful for GoalTracker, only for DeskConsultants. Only develop what I need for my own students.
        

Look into Investors
    Angel Investors seem like the best route to pursue at this point
    First, cover expenses such as Certification and Hosting
    Then try to secure funding to pay coders and content-creators
    If possible, use some funds for marketing
    
Make the landing page do a better job of explaining and selling the app

Make three videos
    One to explain the need for this app
    One to explain the evolution of why it needs to work this way
    One to show samples of the app in action

Upload videos and link to them on social media
    Look at which teacher's forums I should have a presence on
    Tag other teacher's related profiles on Twitter
    Connect on LinkedIn

STUDENTS CAN FLAG A QUESTION
Questions should display the question number to easier finding and editing.
After a quiz, a student can flag a question for the teacher to take another look at the answer.
Or a student can make a suggestion to improve the question

WRITE UPDATE PLAN
Make a plan for how to roll out updates after more users are using the apps.


DEFAULT TERM DATE PLAN
Plan to update default term start and end dates each year
Give mentor teacher a notice if the school's term dates haven't been set.


MAKE A SOLID PLAN FOR TEACHERS WHO WANT TO USE PUBLIC OBJECTIVES
But maybe they don't want to use other teacher's questions.
Also, look into what happens with a public objective that uses private labels.
    Maybe don't allow public objectives to use private labels
    Likewise, public labels shouldn't use private questions



CURRENT TERM SCORES
Bugs are going to happen with current implementation, using a column model when other classes might be set to different terms.
Probably need to make a method that picks out the quiz scores.
Quiz will need a “date completed” column, so it isn’t just going on the “date updated” column.  This approach will allow for 



QUIZ EDITING
Teachers need to be able to update scores for students questions and quizzes
Would be really cool to offer the option to add the student's answer to the list of acceptable answers



HUGE LIST OF LABELS FOR QUESTIONS
Best solution brainstormed so far is to make a "label-viewer" mini-app.
    Whenever labels need to be chosen, show that app.
    It will expand and contract the list based on some choices.  
 The current method of choosing labels is sloppy and cumbersome
    Current idea is to bring up a section when the user pushes "Choose Label"
    The pop-up offers all the labels, better organized
    Ideally, the window would be a pop-up.  But not until I get better at testing javascript
    




ERRORS, FIXES, AND TESTS
Reinstate javascript testing
Fix vulnerabilities that are noted in e-mail

Shrink picture for apple, label, etc.  They should all be the size of the key.
Figure out how to make the link to be the color that I've asked.
    In the meantime, I think I acutally like the blue background for tables with a list of files
    The list of all files, accessed through the content page, needs at least one of these two solutions:
        Either fix the color of the link text, or put a background color on the table.  Or both.
There is a block in the D/C algorithm that probably has no effect

Could probably use a better line than this one: assert_no_text("Teacher Since:") when testing redirection to profile.
Button should say "Finish Quiz" if it's on the last question.

Look into adding multiple records at once with rails and SQL.
    If possible, add new ObjectiveStudents this way

The sign-up screen looks like crap

Learn Options can surely be trimmed.  It calls for the list of objectives three times.  
So TeachOptions can probably be trimmed as well.  

https://www.foraker.com/blog/active-record-includes-query-logic

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45552480/i-need-some-help-implementing-eager-loading?rq=1

Consider making "total_keys" into a db column so that I can query it with SQL.
    Is that worth all the updating that would be needed?
    If I do, add that query to teach_options and learn_options
Should check for assign_permission on the back end to prevent url hacks
Not allowing me to remove 3-2 as a pre-req from 3-3
If student buys item that sold out after he loaded page, it appears to student that purchase is working.
    This tutorial looks helpful for fixing the problem:
    https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby-on-rails/rails-and-ajax.htm
README for loading only specific jquery-ui components.
    https://github.com/jquery-ui-rails/jquery-ui-rails
If a teacher signs in, but doesn't have a school, send them to school-choosing view
Test and re-route for incomplete school info
Admin should be able to destroy students
    And schools
        But what happens to students and teachers when their school gets destroyed.
        This can probably wait for awhile
Deleting a consultancy from its own show page isn't working right now.
Block access to goals until a distant future update when the functions related to goals can be improved.
Can erase most of the javascript for choosing goals, targets, checkpoints, and achievement
    Or maybe not, since I'll need to replace the best-in-place to get my tests working.
    Either that, or I need to update my tests to RSpec
Repeated apple icons need to be different icons
Searching by student number threw an error
Set_objectives_and_scores should be a model method so that it can be better tested
Index of consultancies should show created_at
    So I can get rid of display_date
    Make sure last_consultant_day also works by created_at
Remove 'hide_scores' from the javascript
Note for the user that an objective cannot be deleted from a class if it is a pre-req for an other objective.  Also note which objective we’re talking about. 
Check whether dialog5 is still needed
See if this bit of scss should be re-inserted:
.field_with_errors {
  @extend .has-error;
  .form-control {
    color: $state-danger-text;
  }
}
If a due date is updated to something that isn't a date, back-end needs to change that.
Remove references to 'class_and_edit'
Replace "spacer" and "small_spacer" with padding
Switch the image and text on big links
"Teacher Since" should move to the teacher-editing screen 
Resetting points_this_term should set them to nil, not zero.
Warning that running DC again will delete the previous arrangement from the same day.
Cannot delete a teacher because of the hanging commodities
Navmenu on the quantities is weird
Need a navmenu when giving keys to a whole class
Option to mark consultancy permanent without giving keys
    Or better yet, just don't give keys for objectives that have no questions.  
You could install the exception notifier, which will send you an email for every 500 error including a full stack trace.
When choosing pretests, the objectives should be listed in order by name
Show the number of questions that each objective has
Big link should probably show the icon before the text
Undefined method 'order' when searching for objective
Error upon admin saving new objective
Updating question quantities should give a flash message
Pictures Index needs pagination
Confirm removing <Seminar 1073514> from your classes
fill_in Questions need at least 8 answer choices
Update seminar_bucks_earned or school_bucks_earned each time a new currency is added
    Or when an item is purchased
    Refer to those when loading the view
When editing objectives, etc reroute to objectives index instead of profile
Links are hard to see after used
I think it does take away pretest keys if a class is set to no longer be a pretest.
 But does it do the same if the objective is removed from the class entirely?
 Giving pretest keys should be based on whether the student already has a pretest score.
 To prevent weird things from happening if a student is enrolled in two different classes and the teacher takes away a pretest.
Or if any teacher takes a pretest then gives it back, we don't want to give those students new keys to complete.
Can I re-name the "present" attribute of the seminar student?  That's already a ruby word.
For the sake of performance, the method "set_pretests" should only be called when pretests are changed.  Right now, it is getting called when
    anything about the seminar is changed.
Check pagination everywhere it occurs
Don't block the "Desk Consultants" icon when it isn't availble. Instead, re-route to a screen that explains what is needed.
answer_quiz_randomly should only answer the quiz.  Not begin it.
/home/ubuntu/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.6.0/gems/will_paginate-3.1.0/lib/will_paginate/view_helpers/link_renderer.rb:27: warning: constant ::Fixnum is deprecatedime: 00:08:16,  ETA: 00:01:41
Refreshing the screen while in the question details page creates an error





LESS-IMPORTANT SMALL FIXES
Dry up the four buttons shown in the bottom of seminar navigation
    See what pages they should be included on
Note that Mr. Z school recommends against naming a commodity "Star" or "Gem"




MARKET IMPROVEMENTS

https://www.engineyard.com/blog/zero-downtime-deploys-with-migrations

Mark fewer items delivered in school market
Or mark all items delivered in school market
- The units of money should not use the dollar sign.
  Instead, I think it would be good to either use a letter 'Z' with a line through it (every dollar is called a Z buck)
  or letting the teacher choose from various symbols for their own dollar.
 - Using decimals (at least 0.25 and 0.50).
 Database is not working well with decimal inputs.
 Actually this suggestion came from a student of mine who thought that the MrZ Marketplace would be a good way of teaching and learning decimal operations
(I think I might have already implemented the next three)
1. Buttons for school only on profile page
2. Classes have option to see purchased items for that specific class
3. Visually separate the buttons in the teacher view
Using stars toward grade isn't working

Migrate to allow float



CONSULTANT POINTS AS A METHOD OF DETERMINING CONSULTANT PLACEMENT
Need to rework the sytem so that students don't get blocked off from being consultant until they
    have already been.





DESK CONSULTANTS IMPROVEMENTS

Don't place an apprentice who has 80 or 90, but do allow placing an apprentice who has 60 or 70.
    Probably try that as a last resort, though.
Continue trying to avoid placing a consultant who has scored 100
    But allow it, if needed.  That will help the algorithm be more thorough.
    Make sure to offer extra points to students who end up in that position.
Go by these numbers, not seminar.consultantThreshold
Instead of iterating through apprentices, iterate through the groups and find an unplaced
    apprentice to put into the group.
    This should better use the consultants who were chosen.
    And minimize the need for replacing those consultants into different groups.
No assigning students to topics where they already have keys
DON'T assign a student to a topic if she already has any keys.  Right now it's set to do that as a last resort.  But that doesn't work when doing D/C sessions two days in a row.
    With this change, I might also need to adjust the way that it looks at needed students.  So that Sasha wouldn't be counted as somebody who needs that topic.
Desk Consultants should have “Max Group Size” for topics such as Chess.
There should also be Max Number of groups, so that I don’t end up with more than four groups doing chess when I have four boards.
DC should NOT go back and place students into groups if they've already passed the objective.  New learning is more important than having a group



KEY IMPROVEMENTS
When students take a paper quiz, the keys should go away after the score is entered
Term-changing needs to offer getting rid of teacher keys, dc keys, and unfinished quizzes.
Updating a pre-test shouldn't give keys to students who have already assessed in that objective.
Don't give keys for quizzes that have no questions




BETTER OBJECTIVE SUGGESTIONS
Keep track of which objectives are not good for doing outside of a D/C environment


BROWSING OF ALL STUDY GUIDES
Teachers can browse all study guides

Should check for assign_permission on the back end to prevent url hacks

Figure out why D/C sometimes throws an error.

Not allowing me to remove 3-2 as a pre-req from 3-3

Term-changing needs to offer getting rid of teacher keys, dc keys, and unfinished quizzes.

Updating a pre-test shouldn't give keys to students who have already assessed in that objective.

Fix git remote address

Erase skipped tests

Live site threw an error in 6th period.  Insert/Update violates foreign key constraint.  Trying to add a student to a team.

Index of consultancies should show created_at
    So I can get rid of display_date
    Make sure last_consultant_day also works by created_at



2.89 SMALL, IMPORTANT VISUALS
When editing a question, the box prompt is way too small.
Edit quantities and point values screen is cluttered.
Log out/log in needs some padding from the edge.
Icons should be the same size.
Can I fix the way that icons overlap button when user zooms in?
Submenu buttons should be equal size
The colors are too busy with all the different buttons.
Basic Info Icon doesn't make sense.
Submenus needs a ribbon or something to set it apart.
Don't need the edit button below teacher's name
Page to update pretests for a class should list those objectives in order
Footer message should be random like the header message.
Links are hard to see after used 
Almost all tables need a little bit of padding on the left so that the text isn't touching the table border
More of the tables should be borderless, but the borderless class isn't working on some






    
Precompile for images

I got an error after erasing some of the teacher's classes.  Will that happen to a new teacher?
shit didn't precompile!

TEACHER GRADING IMPROVEMENTS
When creating a new question, "public" and "computer-graded" should be chosen by default
When choosing point values for ObjectiveLabels, they should allow at least 10.  Maybe offer them in multiples of 10.
Take remaining keys for a quiz that needs teacher grading.
As the teacher grades the quiz, she has option to give new keys.
Is the "seminar" column of quiz model neccessary.  It probably shouldn't be, since a quiz can belong to many different classes
Updating the end of the quiz should be a method in the quiz model, not the riposte controller
Don't allow a multiple-choice question to be teacher-graded.
Allow grading for all quizzes, not just those with teacher-designated questions.
    Will need a "Quiz Grading mode" for scoresheet.  This mode shows a button that leads to the quizzes that a student has taken for that topic.
    There, the teacher can select a quiz to edit scores.  
    For extra bonus, teacher can add an answer to the list of correct answers.
    In the future, teacher will suggest the addition.  An admin will need to approve.  Unless the teacher owns that question.
If the highest score possible is less than the previous score from this term, don't waste the teacher's time by submitting the quiz for grading.


NO IN-APP RESPONSE QUESTIONS
A no-response question should be a separate label, different from "multiple choice" or fill_in
Question is not scored when quiz is submitted
When teacher logs in, in-app response questions are included with teacher-graded questions
Question and score space are shown, but no student response.
* Objectives with unfinished quizzes should be excluded from learn_options and teach_options


 
  
 

Prevent user from deleting an objective from a seminar if that objective is a preassign for another.
That's why some objectives cannot be deleted.  I need to find out what they're pre-reqs to.

I think the DC algorithm is working a little too hard not to place a consultant who has scored 100.
But don't fix that until after I implement consultant stars
  It was really struggling to make the seating map in Coding Class, where the pre-reqs are really stacked.

"Create New Students" button should show up on the class edit page















ALLOW FOR TEACHERS TO SEE AND EDIT STUDENT PASSWORDS
Add a "student_password" column to user.
This credential can be used to log in for students.  It can be seen and edited by the teacher.
    Login method checks for authenticate on regular password, then for a match on student password
Will need to link teacher to edit passwords from student edit page
Would be nice if first page leads teachers to the printable version, but that page also has a link to edit all usernames and passwords at once
I took away references to seminar.shouldShowConsultLink.
add some info to explain to teachers that it is needed to use DeskConsultants
Move one_unfinished check to obj_stud
Then put that method back into user.quiz_collection
Are the sponsors affected by the fact that classes allow multiple teachers?
Look up whether my architecture will work better if change the model instead of using a column in the join table
    Seminar :has_many  :pretest_objectives
    This approach seems like I can ruby some things a lot better




OBJECTIVE PERMISSIONS
Ensure unauthorized user cannot edit objective
Set permissions for all actions
    Alternate display if there isn't edit permission
Messages about not editing public objectives need to appear in all submenus.
There should be a direct link to quantities
Show extent even if user cannot edit
Unskip all of the objective-viewing tests
How does the message work no for objectives that have no labels?
Don't give consultant keys for an objective that has no questions
When adding keys to an objective, if a class doesn't include the objective, user gets message 
    "Doesn't include this objective"
    Would be nice if there were a button to add the objective.



CONSULTANCY BACK-TRACKING
Don’t allow teacher to run a new consultancy in the same day if it’s already set to permanent.
Make this clear.
Make an option to delete the consultancy.
This needs to be implemented in a way that takes away student keys and resets the last consultant day.
Should there be a note to remind teachers to mark students as consultants?


HALL PASS APP
Student enters number.
Screen shows who is using the hall pass.
(Tracks time somewhere)
Flashes red if student has already used hall pass twice this week.
    Or too many times in a term.

SLUNK
Manage a class game of slunk








RETURN STUDENT REQUESTS
Update consultant days when student changes her preference request
Update pref_requests to work by -1, 0, 1
    Updating through request screen
    Existing SeminarStudents
Set request to nil if teacher changes an objective to priority zero.
Make sure that the student's request is present in the seminar
    When student changes class
    When objectives are removed from a seminar
Update student requests if pre-reqs change
This only matter if pre-reqs change after the request is made.
Highly corner case, but worth a small update.
 took away the line in the desk consultants algorithm that checks whether an apprentice is ready for her
request.  



    
STUDENT PURCHASED ITEMS
Buttons for school only on profile page
Classes have option to see purchased items for that specific class
Visually separate the buttons in the teacher view


OBJECTIVES NEED OFFICIAL NAMES AND CATCHY NAMES
Display the official name on a pre-test
And in the Objective index
    Option to change in objective index
Display the catchy name in desk-consultants and teacher-granted quizzes
EDIT QUESTIONS
Edit multiple questions at once
Show more of the question prompt in the index
And less space between questions
Show the number for the question so that it can be searched more quickly when there's a small error in one question
 


PRE-REQS OF PRETESTS
If an objective is a pretest, then its pre-reqs also need to be pretests



MAIN TEACHER CAN REMOVE OTHER TEACHERS
Main teacher needs to be able to remove other teachers from a class

COMMODITY CONTROLLER PERMISSIONS
Finish controller permissions to ensure authorized access to commodities
    And they should probably be dried as well
    

    


   
    



Objectives can be marked as a "non-standard" assessment.
If so, it will skip those objectives when assessing readiness during a pre-test
It will still consider those objectives for readiness for the rest of the school year



DELETE COMMODITIES
Still needs to maintain a record of the commodity_students purchased.  At least until database maintenance.

STUDENT CAN SEE A REPORT OF ALL BUCKS RECEIVED


TEACHER CAN SEE A REPORT OF ALL BUCKS GIVEN


REMEMBER WHETHER TEACHER WANTS TO SHOW "ALL OBJECTIVES" OR CURRENTLY-USED OBJECTIVES



TEACHER CAN CREATE COMMODITIES FOR A SINGLE SEMINAR

Mentor teacher can create new teachers who are automatically verified
All of these admin teachers can create new students without placing them into a class
Only stars and gems will offer the use button
Teacher can allow and disallow the use of stars and gems in a specific class
Cannot delete star or gem commodity
Teacher can edit her individual commodities
Teacher can open and close availability for certain commodities
Don't allow teacher to delete stars




WATCH FOR DELETIONS THAT AFFECT OTHER USERS
For example, if you try to delete an objective where other teachers' students have taken quizzes.
Might need to have an alternative to deletion, such as archiving, or hiding.



TEACHER CAN TAKE CLASS CURRENCY (IN CASE OF A MISTAKE)
Admin teachers can create new students without placing them into a class
Teacher can make a comment while giving some currency
Currency moves with student if student changes classes
Teacher can give bucks to whole class.
    Screen that allows unchecking boxes from certain students
    Custom controller action that loops through whole class
    

  
ADMIN CAN SEE CURRENCY REPORTS FOR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS
    
LEVEL 2 ADMIN CAN GIVE TEACHERS MORE BUCKS
    
    
    
LEVEL 2 ADMIN CAN REMOVE A TEACHER FROM THE SCHOOL


QUIZ FINISHING

Show the number of keys left in the quiz report
If student has scored 100, then end-of-quiz message reads, "You have scored 100% on this objective.  There is no need to take the quiz again."







GEM MARKET
Students can buy gems
Gems can be used toward class reward
Gems can be sold back to the market

Teacher can see account values for whole class
Account values screen includes commodities owned and the total value

Screen to keep track of progress toward reward
Teacher can name the reward
Allow teacher to reset reward
Re-establish new reward target based on number of students in class

Allow teacher to customize whether stars and gems can be used in their class
But many commodity attributes need to be set school-wide
    (The main reason to focus on prices school-wide is to reduce competition within a class period)
    Change the supply (number per student per term)
    Standard price
    Day when new items are released
Limit teachers to the number of bucks they can give
    Based on number of students that teacher has

School-wide leaderboard of most class currency
    (only tracks savings account, not commodities)
    Only shows bucks from current term.
    
Class-wide leaderboards of most class currency

Allow a commission on specific classes to change the difficulty compared to other classes

Students gain daily interest on their savings accounts

Future update:
    
    To make the game more fair for students who arrive late, I would like to reset the leaderboard at some point.
        This will also reign in students who begin making ridiculous levels of interest
        But resetting the leaderboard means that I need to set everybody to zero assets.
        How do I do that without robbing students of what they've accumulated?


FLUCTUATING PRICES

Prices of stars and gems fluctuate based on supply in market
    current_price is updated daily
    Each item has a standard price.
    Item's price will equal standard when the supply in the store equals that item's standard supply.
        I think standard amount should equal about five weeks worth of production
    Current price is updated daily. (so that first period doesn't have a huge advantage for being able to buy first)
        Current price is based on standard supply / current supply * standard price
        Add a flat amount to each to ease the spike on ridiculous price increase
            Flat amount is 10% of standard supply
        Examples
            Standard supply   600  (120 x 5 weeks)
            Current supply    900  (Students have bought hardly anything for 2 1/2 weeks)
            700 / 1000 = 0.7 * 5 = $3.5
            
            Current supply  200
            700 / 300 = 2.3 * 5 = $11.67
    Triple the standard is maximum price
    
Students or whole classes can opt out of the price fluctuations.
    The default is to be opted out.

MORE DETAILED REPORT FOR STUDENTS TO SEE HER SCORES

Also, stop putting students as apprentices where they have passed the objective at the consultant threhold.
At the end of a quiz, DC needs to offer students “I don’t want to use the rest of my keys”
There's too much space with all he headers and stuff at the top.  Condense that.


    
    

    
END-OF-TERM STUFF
Give teachers an option to delete unfinished quizzes at the end of a term.
    This will prevent students from finishing quizzes that they started in a previous term
In the same view, also give teacher the option to erase keys
    This will only erase teacher keys and dc keys.  Not pretest keys
    





TESTS FOR UPDATING SCORESHEET
Alert teacher if she's leaving with unsaved changes.


NON-QUIZ OBJECTIVES 
Some objectives, such as paper cranes and tessellations, won't ever offer a quiz.
    So there shouldn't be an option for quiz keys.
    And they should be skipped on the student's quiz offerings.
    
    


TESTS TO ADD

Deleting a picture
Searching
    Right now there's not empty message when there's a student from another school that could show up.
    Make sure Admin can find all students
Deleting a consultancy deletes its teams
Test that incorrect user cannot delete any records from models with correct_owner function
Ensure that database inputs are sanitized
Test failing at creating a record, then fixing it. Needs to apply to creating a new record and also to editing an existing record.
    Objective
    Label
    Picture
    Question
The current extent of an item needs to be checked by default
    Objective
    Label
    Picture
    Question
Add enough question fixtures to test pagination in index
    Same with labels
    objectives
    Students
    Users
The piece of the DC algorithm that places straggling students should also check for the priority of the learnrequest, and whether the student has passed preReqs
If teacher reached "Create New Objective" through a seminar view, re-route to that seminar. If not, re-route to user page.
Test that consultant_days doesn't include other seminars
Test that a limited number of groups are created if many students are qualified to connsult.
    With priority 3's
    And total consultants
Are_some_unplaced test failed once, but it usually passes. I think it failed because @student_10 became a consultant, so he wasn't in the unplaced group.
Test that checkpoints are displayed in the correct order?
Navigating Seminar_Student view. Certain fields should be visible/invisible
Test the navribbon in the seminar edit view.
    I tried writing tests for the navribbon in the student class page, but the visible tags weren't working in the capybara tests.
Student using the sub-tabs to navigate the seminar_student view
Mr. Z School needs to test a student visiting when there is a teacher comment.
Should I enforce that term start and end dates are sequential?  I think I should
Test that absent students cannot be chosen as consultant
Need a test to check the correct amounts displayed for quiz results
    Correct label for stars for pre-test and normal
    Correct amount of stars for pre-test, normal, and second try
Make sure that default password is equal to username.
Make sure that teacher can change password.
    Or maybe just reset it.
Desk consultants test need to ensure that no request go with a student who isn’t qualified for that request.  Or even better, change the request when readiness is changed (which happends after pre-reqs are changed).





ALLOW QUESTIONS TO HAVE MULTIPLE LABELS
Quia had that aspect right.  I should be able to edit a quiz to have
    Name the coordinate with two non-zero values
    Name the coordinate where the x-value equals zero
    Name a point given the coordinate with two non-zero values
    Name a point given the coordinate where the x-value equals zero
    
    If I allowed for multiple labels on question, I could meet all of these ideals
        without having to author four different labels


INCLUDE PARENT E-MAIL FOR STUDENTS
E-mail students when a checkpoint deadline is coming up
    Might need for the teacher to do that manually
    Or maybe an e-mail can be scheduled when the goal is set.
Also e-mail parents
E-mail when a comment is made on a student's goal


OBJECTIVES EDITING VIEWS

Editing objectives should get the same treatment as seminar editing and student view.
Then get rid of the forced redirection to quantities, etc.
Don't show the regular navribbon while editing label quantities.






QUESTIONS YOU MISSED
Students can pull up questions they missed on quizzes. 


CONSULTANT STARS
If a classmate from your consultant team earns growth stars, the consultant earns half that many growth stars. (Round up)
If the classmate has never taken the quiz before, no growth stars will be earned. But the consultant can earn 1/4 of the teammate's fresh stars. (Round up)
Consultant stars should probably be a separate model, just like growth stars. 
They're dated, so the teacher can look at consultant stars for a specific term. 

TOTAL STARS
Show the total number of stars that a student has earned within a term. 
One option is to count all of the quizzes that were taken during the window that the teacher designates.
    It's a bit weird, since a student might get 3 stars for "Angle Concepts" during Term 2, and then earn 5 full stars again for "Angle Concepts" during Term 3. 
        That student will also earn some growth stars.
    I'm leaning toward this option, to give more favor to students who improve from a 9 to a 10. 
        Then again, this student is probably the consultant, so she's probably earning consultant stars in addition to the growth stars. 
Another option is to only count the improvement, which is the growth stars.
    If so, there should be a "growth star bonus" with a minimum of 2 or 3 stars if the student shows any improvement at all.
    This option might hurt the grade a bit for students who only improve from a 9 to a 10. That's only 4 stars, if there's a full bonus. This student would need to complete an extra quiz to stay
        caught up with the students who earned 8 stars for taking a quiz that they hadn't taken before. 
Perhaps the app could find the average between these two options?

ADJUSTMENT STARS FOR STUDENTS WHO JOIN A CLASS LATER
How to pro-rate stars to make things as fair as possible for new arrival students? 
It will take a few rounds before the newer student can have a turn to be consultant. 
And the new student won't be earning many growth stars until she finishes all of her pre-tests
I think I should re-initiate the solution that involves giving that student the median number of total stars to begin with.
But give a little more than the median (maybe 75%) to account for the other aspects.



LIST ABSENT STUDENTS IN DESK CONSULTANTS
Test that absent students are featured in a separate section in DeskConsultants, not the main section


INCLUDE GOALS IN SCORESHEET

And in student's total scores




EASIER SEARCHING
Searching needs to collect results that are similar to what the user typed.
And it isn't downcasing results like it use to. User must match capitalization to find results.


ACCESS
The "Questions" controller needs before_action stoppers
    And the questions_index_test needs to test for them
    And check which other models need similar updates
Look again at Hartl's section about not editing admin via the web.
Ensure that students cannot url into unauthorized objectives
Check before_action for security of student page


APPEARANCE
Most buttons should be turned into big links
There are too many buttons on teacher show page.
    Move most of them into "content-creation" view.
Create icons for
    Benchmark
    School
    Move Student, green arrow pointing right
    Remove Student, red arrow pointing left
Clean up Nav ribbon
Margin on the subtitle under EM Education
Header links are hard to see
If I can't figure out how to make the header stay fixed above the columns, then I at least need to split the table into smaller tables
Use CSS for before/after margin on div class="singleOption" instead of using </br>
Better icons for DConsult, etc.
Put icons on all of the buttons, such as "Create a New Label" and "All Labels" The "All Labels" icon should include more labels than the regular.
"Add rows for ten more students" should be a big_link. Look at all other buttons that should be changed to big links like this one.
Consistent cell size in scoresheet
Consistent cell size in desk-consultants
Zebra striping for scoresheet columns?
Take a closer look at fonts
Look at css for headings
A better visual for the student's total stars can include some big stars for 10 and some giant stars for 100
Small icons for each class period
In the scoresheet, don't show cell border unless cell is focused




STUDENT ALL-GOALS VIEW

Student can open a screen to show all of her goals
Select box for choosing target needs to be smaller
Due date is shown when student checks her main profile


UPDATE CHECKPOINT CHOICES UPON GOAL CHOICE

When teacher chooses a goal, the checkpoint options for that goal are automatically updated
Same for when student is choosing a goal
    Move the checkpoint choices to the same screen
    




TESTING OF PICS

CLEAN UP JAVASCRIPTS AND STYLESHEETS
http://thesassway.com/beginner/how-to-structure-a-sass-project





ORGANIZING PICTURES
Organizing them by label, the way I am currently doing, is a bad idea. Teachers cannot use community pictures for their questions because they cannot
    edit the labels of a picture. Instead, I should prompt the user for whether she wants to be offered pictures from Algebra, Geometry, etc.
Pictures will be associated with those domains.
Find a better way to organize the other long lists, too
    "Labels" comes to mind first


ADD INFO BUTTONS FOR ALL FIELDS ON ALL FORMS
Look for all places where users might need a little extra help/advice
There's a blanked-out info button to explain pre-requisites in the objectives form.
<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" id="btn-info1">?</button>
The jquery for showing those info buttons needs to be dried down to one single function.



AUTO-UPDATE TOTAL
The "total" field in the scoresheet should update upon changing one of that students' scores.
Scoresheet show mean and median for objectives

ACCOUNT ACTIVATIONS
Since the teacher's profile shows a request for them to activate their account, it should also include a link to send a second activation email. 
Or get rid of that message until I do have that taken care of.

CHECK MAILERS
Are they working properly since I reloaded the app?

CURATED CONTENT
Should have another type of user called "Content Creator"
Admin or content creators can curate questions.
Teachers can choose whether their students will see all questions, or only curated questions.


CUSTOM DISPLAY FOR DESK CONSULTANTS
Teachers need to be able to choose how many groups wide their display is.
Someday, consider allowing different-sized groups. Maybe now?

FRIENDLY WARNINGS BEFORE ANNOUNCING
Errors for updating scores to invalid values in the scoresheet

STUDENT REQUEST UPDATING
Update a student's learn_requests when that student passes an objective. 
    If that student had learn_requested to learn the objective she just passed, her learn_request should become neutral.
Remove the part of the D-C algorithm that checks whether student has scored below 100 in his request.



    
PICTURE NEEDS EXTENT

Pictures that are uploaded need to have a column for public/private extent
    And a column for user
Test for all the results of extent that are tested for in the other models
Test for picture AND FOR QUESTION should include changing the extent



******
BEGIN SERIOUSLY ANNOUNCING THE APP
Quora article: Which websites should a Front-end developer look up to for inspiration?
Finish viedoes to explain/market the app
Try to recruit several teachers to begin using and providing feedback
    E-mail teachers who had an account in the old app.
    Talk with MaryAnn Moore

******

ALLOW FIVE LEVELS OF PRIORITY
Instead of 3


STUDENT ALSO HAS A REGULAR PASSWORD
In the future, students will also be able to have a regular password when they turn 18.
    This password cannot be seen or changed by the teacher.  

VIEW A SINGLE GOAL
Also needs to be able to zoom in on one specific goal_student, for conferencing with that student
    View should be the same for both teacher and student


STUDY LINKS
Create "link" model
Teachers and admin can add links to outside websites
    Ideally, they will be links to games and practice activities
Each objectives can be associated with links
Teachers can set those links to outside websites
Students can view them and follow the path.

MORE QUIZ UNLOCKS
Unlock quiz if student has clicked at least two "study links"
    That part should go into the Score model.
    Don't show a quiz available if it has no questions
    

DRY FORM FOR QUESTION CREATION
The form for creating questions is the only one that doesn't use the partial for public/private extent. I paused there because of the input name and because questions
    needs to be pluralized in the new question creator.
    

REPORTS
Show teachers some aggregated data from objectives.
And specific questions.


AWARDS
Students can collect awards with their stars and goal achievements.

TARGETED STUDY GUIDES

The Desk Consultants system that I've been using is not proving very helpful for many students. The next idea that I have to improve the system is to find a way to get each student talking about a 
question he can answer correctly, where possible. Then have the student try to fix a question he missed.

Would be really cool if the app could create them automatically. Pull two correct and two inccorect questions for each student.
    Perhaps even merge them with spaces for taking notes on their groupmate's ideas.
    But students who have never tried that objective will still need the explanatory study guide.

POSSIBLE UPDATE TO D-C ALGORITHM
If no students are proficient in a priority 3 assignments, consider setting the Threshold to consult that topic to be the highest score in class.
    But not if it's zero.


TARGETED STUDY GUIDE
If a student is assigned to a D-C group for an objective she has already tried, teacher can print a custom study guide showing the questions and answers that the student missed on previous tries.


SPIRAL REVIEW
Allow students to take a small review quiz for topics that they've already passed.
Perhaps grant them some kind of points or rewards for these spiral reviews.
If students do porrly on some lables, mark them for some kind of future review or refresher.
In the future, allow hints on spiral reviews and practice quizzes.


DELETING STUDENT REQUESTS FOR SPECIAL-CASE EVENTS
Student might make a request for an objective, but then teachers later changes the priority for the objective or the consutlant threshold for the class.
Perhaps this should be handled by deleting the student's request in either of these events.
Check whether other events should have the same effect.

Don't give pretest keys if a student has already failed a pre-req
(This matters if the teacher adds more pre-tests after students have already begun)

PRACTICE QUIZZES
With some objectives, students should be able to take the quiz as practice
    This will be especially useful for objectives that don't currently have study links
    

TEACHER CAN ADJUST CONSULTANCY
Teacher should be able to move a student from one team to another after the consutlancies are created.
But those moves should check for student readiness. And non-mastery at 100%
Need to be able to save the consultancy after adjusting
In creating Consultant groups, create a group of absent students
    The teacher can pull the absent student out of that group if those students arrive later.

 

DISABLE "NEXT QUESTION" BUTTON UNTIL STUDENT CHOOSES A RESPONSE
Goal: Disable the "Next" button until the student gives some kind of answer
Add a "previous question" button


TEACHERS CAN INVITE OTHER TEACHERS TO THE SCHOOL
If the invited teacher follows the link, their e-mail is auto-filled in the signup form so that it matches the addess that was invited.
The school is also auto-filled.
Teacher invited by the school mentor are automatically verified.


MENTOR CAN REMOVE TEACHERS FROM A SCHOOL
When that happens, all students sponsored by that teacher are removed from the school
   
ENABLE HTML IN QUESTIONS
I can go a long way toward making the questions look nicer if content-creators can use html when creating the prompts and answers.


CREATE LABEL WHILE CREATING QUESTION
I give the option to create a new label while creating questions, then it won't be tedious to add many questions to the 


VETO ANSWER-SCRAMBLING
Option to not randomize the answer choices for multiple-choice questions.




AJAX STUDENT ADDING, SIMILAR TO CLASSDOJO
Make sure that the new system makes it easy to add multiple existing students to a class at once

AJAX SCHOOL ADDING

ADD SOMETHING FUN OR INTERESTING BEFORE MORE BORING FEATURES
Perhaps student comments within classes. 



REFRESHING CERTAIN SCREENS
The "question details" screen causes an error when user refreshes. Perhaps it's because it's a custom view. Maybe I should simply load that functionality into a standard view.
Reloading label form directs to index
    
ONLY ALLOW QUIZ-TAKING ON CERTAIN DAYS AND TIMES        
Main Goal: Teacher can lock and unlock quizzes
    Seminar needs an "unlocked days" attribute.
        It will be an array that includes the available days.
        Unlock time
        Re-lock time
    Teacher can set this up in class attributes once. So that quizzes are open on a certain day between a certain start and end time.
Students cannot take the quiz outside of the open time.
But there also needs to be an "Quick Unlock" button so that teacher can quickly allow quiz-taking on an off-day.

2.98 LABELS BY TOPIC

VT Topic habtm label
VT Label habtm topic
VT Seeds for Label and Topic
VT Fixtures for Label and Topic
VT When creating/editing a question, include an expanding label menu, like in the objective form.
    VT Labels are sorted under topics.


Might need to update the development database so that I can see how the associations are working before I push again to heroku.

You only have 7.5G of total space. Your /etc folder is using up 3.7G, which seems like waaaay too much, and your home directory is 1.3G. Use du -sh * on each of these directories to find out what is using so much space in them and delete them if they are no longer needed. For example, items in your ~/Downloads folder, old logs in /var/log, or whatever is chewing up so much space in /etc.

QUIZ SCORE CALCULATION
Should calculate the final quiz results before going to the quiz show page.
    The way it currently works, it gives results of zero when the student refreshes the screen.
    I think I'll need to add an "old_score" column to quiz table in order to get that working properly.

COPY A CLASS
Save teachers time by copying a class when creating a new one.
    Include settings for objective and pretest.
        But the name of the new class must be unique
When creating a class, there is a list of already-created classes. The teacher can choose one of them to copy.
When creating/editing a class, the first screen shows only the field for class name

COPY AN OBJECTIVE

ADMIN CAN CREATE NEW ADMIN

IMAGES AS ANSWER CHOICES
This feature may not be completely necessary. But it would help with fractions and similar needs.

EQUATION-EDITOR FOR fill_in ANSWERS
Some way for students to enter fractions and exponents in their answers.
    Or maybe implement multi-box fill_in answers. then the student can input the numerator and denominator.

FRIENDLY WARNINGS
Alert the teacher if she is creating a fill_in question without any correct answers
Don't give message, "Students added to class" if zero students were added. Also, give errors if any students were not saved. Do the same with the 
    multi-question creator.
Before the userchanges an objective to priority level 3.
If there's trouble logging in, add a message reminding users that teachers use an e-mail address, but students use a username.


         
ELL STUDENTS
Allow students to be marked as ELL. When that happens, they are default exempt from text-heavy objectives and questions
 


SMALL IMPROVEMENTS TO COMPLETE MUCH LATER
When there's only one public objective, the list looks really weird.
    I'm sure the problem is the same for private objectives.
@created_by needs to include the users full title
Make a partial for the name and extent on each form.
When the user is selecting the number of questions from each label, that select box will be blank for a label that has no questions. This screen 
    needs some kind of warning or explanation for this fact.
When creating a multiple-choice question, don't allow the user to mark a blank answer as the correct answer.
    But at least one answer choice must be marked as true.
    And at least two answer choices are offered.
If student has taken a quiz six times, the oldest attempt is destroyed
In the quiz-finishing screen, give options for the student to change his/her consultant requests.
"Has_objective" method should probably be removed and replaced with rails association
Edit multiple questions at once
Some changes are made by ajax. Some changes are made with a Save + Submit button. That should be consistent.
"I don't like these consultant groups" button after D-C results. User clicks this button to get ideas about how to improve the results.
At the very end, if there's a single student in a group, and another group has the same topic, move one of the students from the group to work with the lone student.
Suggestion to student for which objective to study next should prioritize a score of zero that the student is ready for. 
    I think the same should go for apprentice requests.
Include precondition info in the assigments index.
If a student has already made a request, that request should appear in the student's choices even if it didn't come up from priority and scores.
After performing a search, the search option should default to the previously-used attribute, instead of defaulting to user_number
Home screen should offer log in space instead of having to click the log in button to reach the login form.
Add multiple pictures at once
Allow teachers to delete their own accounts
If user tries to add an existing student to a class twice, it produces a fatal error. But I think that only happens when c9 or something is being super slow.
Print list of student names and passwords
It's awkward that "student_view" is in the seminar controller. It should be in the student controller.
Add Instructions in the Help menu
In the materials, include papers that are given at presentations.
Admin should be able to create classes for the users that they are visiting
Larger font on main headings.
Video to walk people through initial setup.
I commented out the "Remember me on this computer" feature. Should I leave it gone? or should I try to bring it back?
Student awards feature, so students can vote for each other for "Most helpful", "Most creative," "Funniest," etc.
Feature to create seating chart by achievement.
Reset absences upon starting a new day.
Upload student roster from Excel
A system of daily hints that appear upon login. For example: Remind teachers to add objectives that nobody has completed yet. Those will
    become the enrichment objectives for students who are not placed in a group.
On the "New Student" form, highlight the first and last name fields, since they're the only ones that teachers actually need to fill out.
Fix the double horzontal line that shows after each student when somebody searches the student index.
When creating a new objective, should it automatically check the box for the current class if the objectives form was accessed through a class?
It's a little bit weird that user can't leave second answer choice blank. But that's not a really big problem.
Allow teachers and admin to edit their user_numbers upon creation and updating
     offer a field in the regular form, but hide it until a button is pressed.
Right now the make_username method ends by generating a random token if the first four tries fail. If the site ever has a million users, I'll need to ensure that
    it's generating a unique token for the username
Option to show "My questions only" in "All Questions"
Offer to change requests when a student passes an objective.



FIXES FOR GOALKEEPER
When editing a goal, they're all marked as "Private" when the user enters the view. 
Need to allow for multiple teachers to leave comments.
So the comment needs to have the ID of the person who left it.
Need the option to zoom in on one student’s goal
Eliminate the feature where goals transfer with the student.  It's causing an error.
Goalkeeper is showing "Me" when it should be showing student names
Also, when trying to choose a student's checkpoint, it won't allow me to choose something different than the first choice.
  And then it leaves that choice with a blank.
Checkpoint due dates could use a back button
Test checkpoint editing if a due date is nil
Ability to delete a goal option
After a student is moved, the old goal_students should be erased
Custom Goals--Teachers need to be able to create new goals
Ensure that all goals include at least one actions option is offered for all three checkpoints. Otherwise there will be errors.
When writing actions, there should be an option to copy actions from #1 to #3.
Delete goals



SCHOOL MARKET
Class page offers school bucks in the same window as star market
Teacher show page offers a link to student search
Student search offers the panel to give school bucks
OPTION TO PUT "RECENTLY MARKED DELIEVERED" AT TOP
Option to put “recently marked delivered” at top
This will help office staff in case an item was marked as delivered when it shouldn't have been.



OPTIONAL FEATURES TO CONSIDER SOME DAY
Upload student photos. Or have student icons.
Don't show the goal on a student's profile unless teacher has enabled goalkeeper.
D/C Feature to give the teacher a heads-up about how many copies she'll need for an upcoming day of Desk Consultants
